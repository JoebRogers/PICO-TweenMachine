**PICO-TweenMachine** is a small wrapper utility for the **PICO-8** fantasy console, meant as an extension for another library of mine - [PICO-Tween](https://github.com/JoebRogers/PICO-Tween).

The original library simply provided a collection of tweening/easing functions, and their math dependencies for use in your code. This extension exists as a lightweight wrapper to drive all tween related code in clean and clear manner, reducing the boilerplate and mess nestled within your codebase. 

This library currently sits at **239** tokens, not including any actual tweening/easing functions.

Whilst the intent for this library is as an extension to my own port of tweening functions for the **PICO-8**, it is completely dependency free, and will be completely compatible with any of your own tweening functions provided that they take arguments in the same way as traditional **Robert Penner** styled tweens.
